I'm a strong believer in "blame the process, not the person" - Lela Smith

“When major accidents occur, official courts of inquiry are set up to assess the blame. More and more often the blame is attributed to “human error.” The person involved can be fined, punished, or fired. Maybe training procedures are revised. The law rests comfortably. But in my experience, human error usually is a result of poor design: it should be called system error. Humans err continually; it is an intrinsic part of our nature. System design should take this into account. Pinning the blame on the person may be a comfortable way to proceed, but why was the system ever designed so that a single act by a single person could cause calamity? Worse, blaming the person without fixing the root, underlying cause does not fix the problem: the same error is likely to be repeated by someone else.” 
― Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

Design decisions in companies like Panasonic – or at the company you work for right now – are often group decisions made by people from various professions: designers, engineers, managers, etc. If designers are not able to communicate the difference between good and bad design clearly, their insights may get muddled or distorted, or become forgotten and wasted. And that is not because managers, engineers or people from other professions are somehow against good design, but simply because you – as a designer – need crystal-clear and easily communicable examples of the “ingredients” of great design to keep driving home the point that it’s not a luxury—it’s a must-have. If you cannot explain in simple terms what constitutes great design—and why—your designs will become compromised and – consequently – risk becoming design disasters like the examples in this lesson.

This is the place where we will document the learnings and come up with guidelines and policies for effcient project management.
